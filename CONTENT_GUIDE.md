Recommendations for preparing images and content for your website.

## Image Sizes

Uploading correctly sized images keeps your site fast and sustainable.

| Where it's used | Size to upload | Format |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Hero background** | 1920 × 1080 px | JPEG |
| **Full-width image** | 1600 × 900 px | JPEG |
| **Inset image** | 1200 × 675 px | JPEG |
| **Blog featured image** | 1200 × 800 px | JPEG |
| **Social share image** | 1200 × 630 px | JPEG |
| **Gallery images** | 800 × 800 px | JPEG |
| **Logos** | 200 × 80 px | PNG or SVG |

**File size targets:**
- Hero images: under 400KB
- Content images: under 200KB
- Logos: under 20KB

## Before You Upload

1. **Resize first** — Don't upload straight from your camera. Resize to the dimensions above.

2. **Compress** — Use [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) or [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) to reduce file size without losing quality.

3. **JPEG quality 80-85** — This looks great and keeps files small.

## Alt Text

Every image needs alt text — a short description for accessibility and search engines.

**Good examples:**
- "Team meeting in the office kitchen"
- "Close-up of handcrafted ceramic vase"
- "Sarah presenting at the 2024 conference"

**Avoid:**
- "image1.jpg"
- "Photo"
- Leaving it blank

## Hero Images

Hero images span the full screen with text overlaid. For best results:

- Keep the main subject slightly off-centre
- Avoid busy patterns or lots of small details
- Darker images work well (text is easier to read)
- Leave space where the heading will appear

## SEO Fields

Each page has optional SEO fields. Fill these in for better search results:

| Field | What to write | Length |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Meta title** | Page title for Google | 50-60 characters |
| **Meta description** | Summary shown in search results | 150-160 characters |
| **Social share image** | Image shown when page is shared | 1200 × 630 px |

If left blank, sensible defaults are used — but custom text always performs better.
